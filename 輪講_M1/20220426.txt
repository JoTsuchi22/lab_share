Program shape function subroutines for the four-through nine-node element described in Fig.3.7.4.

Assume the IEN array is made available to the routines through the argument list and that if IEN(a) = 0, then node a is absent for the element under consideration.

The IEN array may be taken to have dimension 9 within the routines.

(Note that all operations performed to calculate the shape functions need also be performed to calculate the derivatives.)
