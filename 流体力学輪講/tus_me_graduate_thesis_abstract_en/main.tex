In Finite Element Method (FEM), it is estimated that
the design of the analytical model accounts for about $80\ \%$ of the total analysis.
%
In recent years, Meshfree method have been studied in order to shorten the generation of analytical models.
%
One of them is Isogeometric Analysis (IGA),
which uses Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS),
a geometric representation of CAD,
as basis functions.
%
In addition, the S-version Finite Element Method (S-FEM),
which is a multi-scale analysis that enables flexible modeling and high accuracy of FEM analysis,
has been proposed to be applied to IGA analysis, S-version Isogeometric Analysis Method (S-IGA).
%
In this study, examples of IGA analysis and S-IGA analysis
with higher order of basis functions are presented to verify the accuracy of the analysis.
%
In the IGA analysis, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:1},
the third-order basis functions were more accurate than the second-order basis functions for the same degrees of freedom.
%
In the S-IGA analysis, the highest accuracy was obtained when the order of basis functions was set to the third-order for both the Global and Local patches.
%
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:2} and Figure \ref{fig:3}, the distribution of results was smoother when the third-order basis functions were used.
%
It was also confirmed that setting the ratio of the overall size of the Local patch to the element size of the Global patch
between 2.5 and 4 times prevented the phenomenon of reduced analysis accuracy.
